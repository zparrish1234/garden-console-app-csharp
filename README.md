# garden-console-app-csharp
Console-based garden simulation built in C# to demonstrate object-oriented design, inheritance, and state management through interactive user input.

# Overview
This project is a console-based garden simulation written in C#. It was created to practice object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, and polymorphism. The application allows users to manage different plant types, apply environmental effects, and track plant growth through an interactive menu-driven interface.

# Tools Used
- C# (.NET Console Application)

# Key Features
- Create and manage multiple plant types (Flower, Vegetable, Herb) using inheritance
- Track plant health and growth stages over time
- Apply randomized weather effects (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Stormy) that impact plant health
- Perform actions through an interactive menu (view status, water, grow, add plants, view all plants)
- Type-specific behaviors:
  - Flowers can bloom when mature and healthy
  - Vegetables track harvest readiness and can be harvested
  - Herbs track aroma strength and cutting frequency

# What I learned
- Designing class hierarchies using inheritance and polymorphism (overriding methods)
- Managing program state with collections (tracking multiple plants in a list)
- Writing maintainable console applications with input validation and a game loop
- Translating simple “rules” (health thresholds, growth stages, weather effects) into code logic
